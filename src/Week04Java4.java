		int subtraction = ages[ages.length-1]-ages[0];
		//Using length - 1 will give you the last element in the array, since it is a 0 based system, you can't use ages[8] because it would be out of bounds. 

//b. Create a new array of int called ages2 with 9 elements (ages2 will be longer than the ages array, and have more elements).  
		int[] ages2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
